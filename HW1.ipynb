    "# Homework 1: Information Retrieval\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "1. Students will form teams of three people each and submit a single homework for each team in the format - ID1_ID2_ID3.ipynb\n",
    "2. Groups of three!\n",
    "2. **Do not write your names anywhere.**\n",
    "3. For the code part: \n",
    "> **Write your code only in the mentioned sections. Do not change the code of other sections**. Do not use any imports unless we say so.\n",
    "4. For theoretical questions, if any - write your answer in the markdown cell dedicated to this task, in **English**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deviation from the aforementioned  instructions will lead to reduced grade\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clarifications\n",
    "1. The same score for the homework will be given to each member of the team.  \n",
    "2. The goal of this homework is to test your understanding of the concepts presented in the lectures. \\\n",
    "Anyhow, we provide here detailed explanations for the code part and if you have problems - ask.\n",
    "3. Questions can be sent to the forum, you are encouraged to ask questions but do so after you have been thinking about your question. \n",
    "4. The length of the empty gaps (where you are supposed to write your code) is a recommendation (the amount of space took us to write the solution) and writing longer code will not harm your grade. We do not expect you to use the programming tricks and hacks we used to make the code shorter.   \n",
    "Having said that, we do encourage you to write good code and keep that in mind - **extreme** cases may be downgraded.  \n",
    "We also encourage to use informative variable names - it is easier for us to check and for you to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience, , the code has a **DEBUG** mode that you may use in order to debug with toy data.  \n",
    "It is recommended to solve the code in that mode (with efficiency in mind) and then run the code on all the data.\n",
    "**Do not forget to file the HW with DEBUG == False**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is the first time we provide this homework please notify us if there is a bug/something is unclear, typo's exc..\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We use Python 3.7 for programming.\n",
    "6. Make sure you have all the packages and functions used in the import section. Most of it is native to Anaconda Python distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Have fun !"

Rosie, Rosie I wanna take you away.. Rosie, Rosie I'm gonna make you mine someday.. Rosie I went with you for that rose tattoo. You promised no one else would see. I used to wait and drive you home from dancing school.. Remember when you danced just for me. Our love was deeper than the night was long. But things just didn't work out like our favorite song. I used to watch you walking down the hall. Rosie do you see me when you hear them call your name. Rosie, Rosie, I wanna take you away.. Rosie, Rosie, I'm gonna make you mine someday. Rosie, Rosie.

    "For this part of the assignment, you will not ignore the “stop words” in advance, but rather take a data-driven approach. you will first create a dictionary with keys representing the words in the corpus and values representing how many times each word appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a simple visualization (scatter plot), you will then check whether the frequency of the words corresponds to Zipf's law.  Once we see that this is indeed the case, we'll try to display the graph on a logarithmic scale (both x and y axis) and see if we can get a linear trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each word should then weighted according to its frequency, so that the words that appear most often are given a lower weight, and so on for the words whose frequency is the lowest.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how we are going to do that?\n",
    "You will standardize all the frequency values in the dictionary and after that, they will be re-weighted. If the value of the word is less than zero after standardization, you will calculate P(X <=Z) and if the value of the word is greater than 0, you will calculate 1 - P (X <= Z), and this will be the weight for every word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you will multiply the standard “tf” calculation we made at the beginning of the assignment by another coefficient, which is the weight we just calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we will perform the same query you performed in the previous part of the assignment and check if the returned documents are identical or different.\n"
