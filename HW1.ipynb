    "# Homework 1: Information Retrieval\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "1. Students will form teams of three people each and submit a single homework for each team in the format - ID1_ID2_ID3.ipynb\n",
    "2. Groups of three!\n",
    "2. **Do not write your names anywhere.**\n",
    "3. For the code part: \n",
    "> **Write your code only in the mentioned sections. Do not change the code of other sections**. Do not use any imports unless we say so.\n",
    "4. For theoretical questions, if any - write your answer in the markdown cell dedicated to this task, in **English**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deviation from the aforementioned  instructions will lead to reduced grade\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clarifications\n",
    "1. The same score for the homework will be given to each member of the team.  \n",
    "2. The goal of this homework is to test your understanding of the concepts presented in the lectures. \\\n",
    "Anyhow, we provide here detailed explanations for the code part and if you have problems - ask.\n",
    "3. Questions can be sent to the forum, you are encouraged to ask questions but do so after you have been thinking about your question. \n",
    "4. The length of the empty gaps (where you are supposed to write your code) is a recommendation (the amount of space took us to write the solution) and writing longer code will not harm your grade. We do not expect you to use the programming tricks and hacks we used to make the code shorter.   \n",
    "Having said that, we do encourage you to write good code and keep that in mind - **extreme** cases may be downgraded.  \n",
    "We also encourage to use informative variable names - it is easier for us to check and for you to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience, , the code has a **DEBUG** mode that you may use in order to debug with toy data.  \n",
    "It is recommended to solve the code in that mode (with efficiency in mind) and then run the code on all the data.\n",
    "**Do not forget to file the HW with DEBUG == False**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is the first time we provide this homework please notify us if there is a bug/something is unclear, typo's exc..\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We use Python 3.7 for programming.\n",
    "6. Make sure you have all the packages and functions used in the import section. Most of it is native to Anaconda Python distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Have fun !"

Now you act as if I'm just a burden.. I've finally let go.. Stay silent at least for now, and let me move on.. 'cause I'm so done playing these games with my heart. I've been around the world and back for you,. And now its time to choose.. I've been swallowed by this wreck that you call your life.. I'm damaged from the inside. I've been broken.. Don't threaten me with what you think I feel.. If you could read my mind you'd be in tears.. I'm sick of your excuses you hold above me.. I've finally come to terms with what I am.. I'm nothing in your eyes, and this will not change.. I'm living in a dream.. Stay silent at least for now, and let me move on.. I'm done playing these games with my heart. I've been around the world and back for you,. And now its time to choose.. And i'll close my eyes, and dream of a better time. When I'm finally past this and happy on my own.. I've done all I can, and i've still been cast aside.. All I ever wanted to be was be the one. Who would wipe those tears from your eyes.. But I guess i'll play second best,. To a world that will never care about you.. When will you understand to them you're just another pretty face?. You'll tell me that you care, and then run straight back to him.. I can hear your words of treason from a mile away.. You never did know how to whisper.. You fuckin liar. Tell me the truth.. Do the world a favor stop cutting your arms,. And slit your throat \n",

Life will never, never be the same. Time runs over. The course of nature’s way. Spinning around you. Millions of screams. Deafen all your sanity. Fast decay, no delay. Minutes are lost in sublime. Running fast you’re only. A flash inside the pain. Life will never, never be the same. Time runs over. The course of nature’s way. All day you feel lonely. Cause you know. The years have gone by. They’ll never come again. Life is overrated. But who will ever know. Life will never, never be the same. Time runs over. The course of nature’s way. . (fonte: site oficial) \n",

We were different, just like all the other kids. Missy was a teen blue video star. Tom took his life in his mother's car. Milo went to college but you knew about that. Rodney played our record. Jimmy started riots. Laurie was always quiet, she was battling depression. Hey, you, Is there something worth belonging to? and. can I pick it up for a song, or a diploma, or a worthy cause?. Well, let me tell you that there's nothing wrong. It's just the ones like us will never belong. Jack wore a skirt but he knew how to scrap. Billy went to county on a class-one possession. Wendy went to school while her daddy shot smack. Eugene kept a list. Mugger was security. Mary, she kept her purity. We were all in it together. Yellowed postcards on the wall. serve to cover up the blankness after all. so I will carry them along, like a song, when I'm gone. Hey, you, Is there something worth belonging to?.
