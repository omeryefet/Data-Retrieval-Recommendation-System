    "# Homework 1: Information Retrieval\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "1. Students will form teams of three people each and submit a single homework for each team in the format - ID1_ID2_ID3.ipynb\n",
    "2. Groups of three!\n",
    "2. **Do not write your names anywhere.**\n",
    "3. For the code part: \n",
    "> **Write your code only in the mentioned sections. Do not change the code of other sections**. Do not use any imports unless we say so.\n",
    "4. For theoretical questions, if any - write your answer in the markdown cell dedicated to this task, in **English**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deviation from the aforementioned  instructions will lead to reduced grade\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clarifications\n",
    "1. The same score for the homework will be given to each member of the team.  \n",
    "2. The goal of this homework is to test your understanding of the concepts presented in the lectures. \\\n",
    "Anyhow, we provide here detailed explanations for the code part and if you have problems - ask.\n",
    "3. Questions can be sent to the forum, you are encouraged to ask questions but do so after you have been thinking about your question. \n",
    "4. The length of the empty gaps (where you are supposed to write your code) is a recommendation (the amount of space took us to write the solution) and writing longer code will not harm your grade. We do not expect you to use the programming tricks and hacks we used to make the code shorter.   \n",
    "Having said that, we do encourage you to write good code and keep that in mind - **extreme** cases may be downgraded.  \n",
    "We also encourage to use informative variable names - it is easier for us to check and for you to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience, , the code has a **DEBUG** mode that you may use in order to debug with toy data.  \n",
    "It is recommended to solve the code in that mode (with efficiency in mind) and then run the code on all the data.\n",
    "**Do not forget to file the HW with DEBUG == False**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is the first time we provide this homework please notify us if there is a bug/something is unclear, typo's exc..\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We use Python 3.7 for programming.\n",
    "6. Make sure you have all the packages and functions used in the import section. Most of it is native to Anaconda Python distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Have fun !"
